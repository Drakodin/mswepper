Minesweeper, but with different modes that make it just that much harder.

## Currently Supported Variants
- Microsoft Minesweeper
- Google Minesweeper

### Special Variants
- Non-standard Depth - Games will play with block depth of 2 rather than 1, creating a much more difficult experience. Flags will operate the same as 1-depth games and thus may be less reliable.
- Expert difficulty - Though Microsoft claims their Expert difficult is the top, it is the equivalent of Google's Hard. Thus, an additional difficulty that is a true "Expert" difficulty has been added. The boards are slightly larger with 35-50% more mines.
